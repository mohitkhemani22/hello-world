# hello-world
Getting started with GitHub.

Hello there.
I'm Mohit and I'm just doing what this hello-world thing present in https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ is telling me to.
So there's nothing here that you are going to find interesting. 
Do yourself a favor and go get some work.
